# Einstein and the Quantum NLP Project
This repository contains the code and resources for the Einstein and the Quantum NLP Project. The project aims to explore the book "Einstein and the Quantum: The Quest of the Valiant Swabian" by A. Douglas Stone using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to gain insights into the book's content, analyze its linguistic characteristics, and visualize key concepts through various NLP tasks.
This project is inspired by Avery smith. 
<br> Here is the link to his video where he explains this project in depth- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZNNdJro_sw&t=101s

**Libraries used are NLTK, SpaCy, Pandas, Numpy, Plotly and Matplotlib.**
<br> Since GitHub doesnt support Plotly, here is the link to nbviewer where you can check out the book_analysis

# Project Highlights
- Calculated word lengths and discovered hidden connections using concordance.
- Utilized NLTK functions like similar(), generate(), vocab(), and common_context() for in-depth linguistic analysis.
- Visualized word dispersion throughout the book with a dispersion plot.
- Implemented advanced text preprocessing techniques for data cleaning and preparation.
- Examined frequency distribution to identify prevalent words and core themes.
- Discovered meaningful word collocations to capture significant word pairs and phrases.
- Leveraged spaCy for Named Entity Recognition, unveiling prominent entities and their relationships.
- Visualized Part-of-Speech (POS) tags and syntactic dependencies.
- Utilized the BILOU scheme for entity recognition.
- Implemented various NLP tasks such as text preprocessing, frequency analysis, collocation identification, and visualization techniques.
- Created a wordcloud, and masked them onto images, to visualize key concepts.
